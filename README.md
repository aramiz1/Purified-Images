# Purified-Images

This is a Java GUI image viewing app that I have developed. A user registers in the program with a username and password that is stored in an online MySQL database from this website: http://www.freesqldatabase.com/ and can login to upload, save, delete and purify (convert to grayscale) images as they please. 

The database host's website requires weekly affirmation that it is still being used. If not, it will be erased due to inactivity.
